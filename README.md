#Welcome to HIST3907b, Winter 2014 @carleton_u

Digital history “is partly about understanding what digital tools have to offer, but also (and perhaps more importantly), about exploring what ‘digital’ does to how we understand the past, and ourselves. [...] The digital turn has generated a plethora of born-digital and digitized sources, offering both challenges and exciting new avenues of inquiry. Using computational approaches like social network analysis and text mining enables new explorations of historical cultures and larger scale synthetic understandings of the past.” – Graham, Milligan, and Weingart 2013, http://www.themacroscope.org/

This course is about data mining history, about visualizing what we find, and working out how to best communicate those findings. It is about writing history in digital media, which are primarily visual media. Thus, we will learn how to scrape data, how to find meaningful patterns within it, and how to visualize (via websites or infographics) those results. Readings will be from relevant literature in the field (mostly online).

*YOU DON’T NEED TO BE TECHY* (whatever that may mean) to succeed in this class. You DO NEED to be willing to try things out, to be able to experiment and reflect on what works and what doesn’t.
